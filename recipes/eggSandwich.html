    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Breakfast lovers, rejoice! This is essentially just a grilled cheese sandwich with an omlette in the middle.
        Feel free to add the meat of your choosing, or don't! It's delicious by itself.
    </p>
    <p>Thank me later.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Bread, 2 slices</li>
        <li>Butter, 1 tbsp</li>
        <li>Mayonaise</li>
        <li>Cheddar Cheese, 1-2 slices</li>
        <li>Eggs, 2</li>
        <li>Meat, optional</li>


    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by preheating your skillet on medium low heat. Add butter and wait for it to begin to brown.</li>
        <li>Spread mayonaise on one side of each bread slice.</li>
        <li>Once butter has began to brown, place one slide of bread mayonaise-side down on the skillet.</li>
        <li>Place the cheese on the topside of the bread in the skillet to allow it to begin to melt.</li>
        <li>Place the other slice on top of the cheese, mayonaise-side up.</li>
        <li>While the first side of the sandwich is grilling, crack 1-2 eggs into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to whisk vigorously until the egg mixture is smooth with a consistent texture.</li>
        <li>Flip the sandwich in the skillet to begin grilling the other side.</li>
        <li>Remove the sandwich from the skillet.</li>
        <li>If necessary, add more butter. Otherwise, pour in the eggs.</li>
        <li>Try to form the eggs into a square-ish shape approximately the size of your bread.</li>
        <li>Open the sandwich and scoop the eggs onto the cheese.</li>
        <li>At this point, add ham, sausage, or bacon as desired.</li>
        <li>Close the sandwich and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
